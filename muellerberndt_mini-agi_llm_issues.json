    "body": "# PoC-MiniAGI-RCE\n\n## 1. Commands\n\n### Summary\nWhen using a security analysis tool to analyze MiniAGI (the latest commit branch on GitHub is d2add8f), we discovered a security risk in the `miniagi.py` file during initialization. \nThe risk is triggered by the exec statement call in the `Commands.execute_python()` method. If developers deploy MiniAGI on a server for users to interact with and pass malicious commands directly as parameters to `miniagi.py` without any additional handling, MiniAGI will use the malicious command in subsequent processes to interact with the large model. \nThe model will return malicious code based on the instructions of the malicious command, and MiniAGI will execute this malicious code in its later processing stages.\nThe valunerable code is shown in the figure below and is marked accordingly.\n\n![ÂõæÂÉè2025-5-23 17 17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e786270e-442f-433a-951d-9b2f2b052578)\n\n\n\n### PoC\nPlease review the fallow code:\n```shell\n$ python3 miniagi.py print(__import_('os').system('ls -al'))\n```\n\n\n### Impact\nAs shown in the figure below, by executing the code `__import_('os').system('ls -al')`, an attacker can list all files on the server where the Agent is deployed. \nSimilar payloads can also be used to view sensitive information (e.g., passwords) or delete files.\n\n<img width=\"1130\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/881db4cd-1923-40ce-a0e4-a7e54306ec3b\" />\n\n\n\n### Weaknesses\nCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n\n### Environment information\nLLM type and model name: OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo\n\nSystem version: MacOs 14.3.1\n\nPython version: python3.12\n\nMiniAGI version or branch: git commit <= d2add8f\n",
