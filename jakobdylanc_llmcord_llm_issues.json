        "body": "I'm glad you're enjoying llmcord! & yeah sorry about the lack of comments...maybe I should add some more haha.\n\nI like your ideas. The biggest issue is that different providers currently handle reasoning content differently.\n\nWith Ollama it looks like the the reasoning content is always returned in the main `content` field with \\<think> tags as you mentioned. But with OpenRouter for example, the reasoning content is NOT included unless you set `include_reasoning: true` in your API parameters. And even then it's still returned as a separate `reasoning` field instead of being included in `content`. I like this behavior better.\n\nI'm hoping that all providers eventually agree on a single standard, otherwise it'll be much more of a pain to implement while maintaining universal compatibility.\n\nAlso with the .txt file attachment idea, I question whether the .txt file should include the ENTIRE response or JUST the reasoning content. I feel like including the entire response can be useful sometimes, like when the response gets split into multiple Discord messages."

It needs to know the user's Discord ID in order to @ them.\n\nThe easy solution is to actually @ the user in your message, like I did below. The bot sees it as `<@ID>`, so it sees the user's ID, and is able to replicate the format back.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/700329f5-16a4-4046-a78f-e5160b243da2)\n\nI get this isn't exactly what you want though...open to more feedback :)\n\n> I also have plain response enabled. Does it need to be turned off?\n\nYou need `use_plain_responses: true`, otherwise it uses embeds which won't properly @ the user.\n\n> Is there a list of models that support user identity?\n\nAny model from OpenAI API or xAI API supports user identity. I'm not aware of any others. When you use one of these models, the bot knows your Discord ID automatically without you first having to tell it."

It COULD work, but it'd be better off as an entirely separate project designed from the ground up for assistants. I also just want to keep llmcord focused purely on LLMs.\n\nAssistants are also pretty expensive IIRC. I feel like there's better/cheaper ways to achieve what you want with a regular LLM."

Just did though, and I see the issue.\r\n\r\nIt indeed looks like `finish_reason` is always `None` which is definitely incorrect on their part.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the final chunk contains both `finish_reason` and `finishReason`. And it looks like only `finishReason` contains the actual finish reason (in this case `stop`), while `finish_reason` (the correctly named one) remains `None`.\r\n\r\nI see other issues too...like the content of each chunk is way too long. Here's some that I saw for example:\r\n```\r\ncontent=' carp:\\n\\nBartholomew \"Barty\" Butterfield, a taxider'\r\ncontent=\"mist with a penchant for sherry and questionable hygiene, inherited his great-aunt Mildred's dilapidated mansion – a gothic monstrosity clinging precariously to a cliff\"\r\ncontent=' overlooking a churning, grey sea.  Mildred, a recluse with a rumored penchant for necromancy (and possibly tax evasion), left Barty only'\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersus with OpenAI's API they're nice and small:\r\n```\r\ncontent='Oh'\r\ncontent=','\r\ncontent=' sure'\r\ncontent=','\r\ncontent=' absolutely'\r\ncontent=','\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoogle's OpenAI API is still in beta so hopefully we'll see these issues resolved. Otherwise I'll have to bandaid fix it in llmcord :)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I recommend using Google models through OpenRouter. Those have issues too...but you can avoid them by setting `use_plain_responses` to `true`."

Not ideal.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is making the bot react to your message with a :hourglass: to let you know that it's processing. If the response is successful then the reaction is removed.

Feel free to experiment with it yourself though!\r\n\r\nI experimented a bit with gpt-4o-audio-preview. I think it's fairly easy accepting user voice messages as input. The tricky part is getting the bot to send a voice message back.\r\n\r\nIn Discord's API, a voice message is a special kind of message and the discord.py library I'm using doesn't support this at the moment. Without sending a PROPER voice message, it's just an audio attachment that isn't playable on mobile devices. So...not ideal."
